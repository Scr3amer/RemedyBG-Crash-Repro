# RemedyBG-Crash-Repro
Found a crash repro for RemedyBG  v0.3.8.7

To repro it you need the dynamic accurate monitor name fetching feature of GLFW. It is still in review but you can get it here:  
https://github.com/Scr3amer/glfw/tree/Dynamic-accurate-monitor-name-fetching

I use this toolchain, I don't know if bug would happen with any other toolchain:

I put a cmake with my build config.
